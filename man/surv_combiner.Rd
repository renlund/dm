surv_combiner(..., comb.type = "EELC", surv.output = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Surv objects}

\item{comb.type}{how the Surv objects are combined. 'EELC' thinks of the
Surv objects as informative of each other, e.g. if the first observation
in the first row is censored at 1 for the first variable and at 2 for
the second variable, then the combination will pick the second one. More
specifically, it will pick the earliest event (as an event) if there is
at least one event, and it will pick the latest censored (as censored)
if there are no events. 'earlist' thinks of the Surv objects as being
very distinct, so it will simply pick the earliest time (as event or
censored).}

\item{surv.output}{return a Surv object (default \code{TRUE}), else a data
frame with variables \code{time} and \code{event}.}

\description{
